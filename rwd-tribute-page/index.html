        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.</li>
          <li>Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.</li>
          <li>Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.</li>
          <li>You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.</li>
          <li>I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.</li>
          <li>I... a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe.</li>
          <li>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.</li>
          <li>Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.</li>
          <li>The highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and human compassion.</li>
          <li>I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned.</li>
          <li>We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress.</li>
          <li>I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.</li>
